    "## Jets in particle physics\n",
    "A proton-proton collision can result in production of high energy quarks and/or gluons. In addition, other particles like a Higgs boson, W boson, etc can also decay into quarks. However, these quarks and gluons are not directly observed in the final state of the collision. This is because these quarks and gluons themselves tend to emit quarks and gluons at small angles or with small energy. This results in a series of collimated quarks and gluons. Once low energy scale is reached (of the order of 1 GeV), due to the nature of strong force [<sup>1</sup>](#confinement), these quarks and gluon combine to form hadrons. So, the end product of quark/gluon production in collisions are a bunch of collimated hadrons which are called **jets**. This means jets are proxies to the quarks and gluons produced in collisions, i.e. studying jets can give information about the particle that initiated the jet. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do you decide which hadrons belong to one jet vs the other (for example in decay of W boson into two quarks)? There has to be a quantitative definition of jets which experimentalists and theorists can both agree on. So, what a jet is depends on a **jet definition**. A typical jet definition is a combination of three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **jet algorithm**: it is a recipe on how to cluster hadrons to form jets. \n",
    "- A **jet radius**: it is a parameter of the jet algorithm which basically defines a distance above which two particles are not considered part of the same jet. \n",
    "- A **recombination scheme**: it is a scheme which defines how the kinematic properties of the jet are obtained from its consituents. For example, in the \"E-scheme\" the jet momenta and energy are obtained by a simple sum of components of consituents energy-momentum four vector. \n",
    "    \n",
    "There are a number of jet algorithms available. At the LHC the most widely used jet algorithm is anti-kt algorithm which is a type of sequential recombination algorithm [<sup>2</sup>](#generalized-kt). The sequential recombination algorithms try to invert the QCD process of quark/gluon branchings by iteratively recombining two particles into one until a few objects are left and then calls them jets. In case of anti-kt algorithm, the particles are clustered around the hadron with the largest transverse momentum. \n",

Source: <a href=\"https://gsalam.web.cern.ch/repository/course-slides/2024-Oxford/Oxford-jets-lecture.pdf\">Gavin Salam jets lectures, slide 119 </a>. The x-axis shows the \"rapidity\" of particle (essentially a proxy for polar angle of the particle) and y-axis shows the transverse momentum of the particle in GeV. Since anti-kt algorithm clusters around particle with high transverse momentum, the starting point of clustering is particle near rapidity of 2 with the highest tranverse momentum. The first particle to cluster into it is the particle nearby it at around rapidity of 1.6. This is shown by the small semi-rectangle above the two particles. The clustering combines both the particles into one. The next particle to cluster into the resulting particle is the one closest to it, i.e. the particle at rapidity of around 1.1. This is shown by semi-rectangle above the particle at rapidity of 1.1 and particle at rapidity of around 1.8. The clustering and combining of particles goes on until all particles are clustered into a single particle (denoted by the black vertical line). Note that this is a very simplified picture. A more realistic picture would additionally need to consider the azimuthal angle of particles, and the jet radius according to the recipe in [<sup>2</sup>](#generalized-kt)\n",

    "## Large-R jet tagging\n",
    "The jet radius $R$ is one of the most important parameters of jet algorithms. If its value is large, the resulting jet is called large-R jet. How large is large? This depends... ATLAS experiment considers jets with R=1 as large-R jets whereas CMS experiment uses R=0.8. Both experiments use R=0.4 for their small radius jets. Note that the $R$-parameter doesn't have to be fixed. One can have algorithms where $R$-parameter varies with the transverse momentum of the jet (the so-called Variable Radius jets). But why care about large-R jets? Let's take an example of Higgs boson decay to two bottom quarks. There are two regimes one can have:\n",
    "- Low Higgs transverse momentum (so called \"resolved\"): In this case the two quarks coming from Higgs decay have larger angular separation which results in the decay products being able to be reconstructed as two separate small-radius jets.\n",
    "- High Higgs transverse momentum (so called \"boosted\"): In this case the angular separation between the two quarks is small. So, the decay products could be clustered into two small-radius jets or one large-radius jet. However, in the boosted regime, we use large-radius jets. This is because the internal sub-structure of the large-radius jets can be exploited for identification of the jets. A rule-of-thumb for large-radius jets is that it makes sense to use them when the transverse momentum of the parent-particle is greater than twice the mass of the particle, i.e. $p_t > 2 \\cdot m$. In case of Higgs boson this would be $p_t \\sim 250$ GeV.\n",

    "Tagging, in context of jets in particle physics, refers to identifying objects that initiated the jet. For example, one can try to identify whether a small radius jet was initiated by a bottom quark or gluons or light quarks like up and down quarks (called \"b-tagging\"). One can also try to identify whether a large radius jet was initiated by a top quark, a W boson, or quark/gluons, etc. Large-R jet tagging is important both in search for new physics and for studying standard model processes. For example, Higgs boson can decay into a pair of bottom quarks. When Higgs momentum is large, both bottom quark jets will be reconstructed as one large-R jet. A X to bb tagger would be able to identify Higgs decaying to two bottom quarks. \n",

The list of layers should contain at least one `Input` layer whose shape (dimension) should have same dimension as number of input features and one output `Dense` layer whose dimension should be equal to the number of classes (quark,gluon,top) that you expect (3 in this case). You can add more `Dense` layers in between. Try with different number of `Dense` layers. Each `Dense` layer has an `activation` option which will determine which kind of non-linear operation to perform on the output. Try with `relu` (rectified linear unit, which defined by $f(x) = 0\\ \\text{if}\\ x\\leq 0, f(x) = x\\ \\text{if}\\ x > 0$). For the output layer, we want a continuous \"probability distribution\" as output so that we have a \"probability score\" that the network assigns to each of the class. Since probabilities should add up to zero, we need an activation function that transforms the scores so that they add up to 1. This can be achieved using \"softmax\" activation in the output layer. Given an output score $p_i$ for the $i^{th}$-class, softmax of $p_i$ is given by: $$\\text{softmax}(p_i) = \\frac{e^{p_i}}{\\sum_{j=1}^n e^{p_j}}$$"

    "Now that we have a model, we need to configure the model, i.e., give the model a way to compare its prediction with actual label/result. This is done by using `compile` method of tensorflow model and passing it a loss function.  An example of loss function for regression is mean squared error (MSE): $\\sum (y_{\\text{actual}})^2 - y_{\\text{pred}}$. Suppose you have a model that predicts the price of a house based on various features such as the location, amenities, etc. If your model predicts $100$k for a house when the actual price is $1$ million, then your model hasn't quite learned the actual model underlying the data; in this case MSE would be large, thus telling that the model needs to do better. \n",

    "The goal of machine learning is essentially to minimze the loss - the model needs to change its weights so that loss is reduced, i.e. move in the direction opposite to the increasing loss. This is done by using gradient of loss function with respect to the weights. Since direction of gradient is the direction of steepest ascent, if we move in the direction opposite to the gradient of loss function, we will minimize the loss. This can be seen from a simple 2 dimensional plot of $x^2$. The global minimum is at $x = 0$ and if you move in either $x>0$ direction or $x < 0$ direction, value of $x^2$ increases. The derivative of $x^2$ is $2x$. For $x < 0$, the derivative is going to be negative; if you move in the opposite direction to the derivative, that is in the direction of positive x, you will eventually reach the minima, $x = 0$. For $x > 0$, the derivative is going to be positive, so if you move in the direction opposite to positive $x$, i.e. in the direction of negative $x$, you will eventually reach the minima, $x = 0$.\n",

For binary classification, cross-entropy of an example/event is given by $-[y \\log(p) + (1-y)\\ \\log(1-p)]$, where $y$ is the actual label, and $p$ is the output score of softmax (can also be written as $- \\sum_{i = 1}^2 y_i \\cdot log(p_i)$ with $p_1 = p$ and $p_2 = 1-p_1 = 1-p$). If the correct label is $y=1$ and $p$ is close to one, this quantity would be close to 0. If the correct label is $y = 0$ and $p$ is close to 0, then again this quantity would be close to 0. If values of $y$ and $p$ are not close, then the quantity would be further away from 0. One can take an average of cross-entropy across all data samples to get total cross-entropy loss.

However, we will use a logratio and plot it. For each label/class, compute $\\log ((p_i)/(p_j + p_k))$; for example, if your interest is top jet, you would compute $\\log((p_2)/(p_0 + p_1))$ where $p_2$ is the softmax probability corresponding to top class (third score), $p_0$ is the softmax probability corresponding to gluon jet class, and $p_1$ is the softmax probability corresponding to quark jet class. Then plot this log ratio for the three classes in the same plot. (if this doesn't make sense, talk with the instructor).\n",

    "Finally, apply a \"cut\" on the log ratio. Basically, require that the log ratio is greater than or smaller than some number so that you have higher number of top quark jets passing the cut and low number of other jets. After applying the cut, check how many top jets, gluon jets, light quark jets pass the cut. You can also check the percentage of top jets that pass the cut, and so on for other jets; for instance, if your validation sample had `n_t` total top jets, and `m_t` top jets pass the cut, get the ratio `m_t/n_t`.
